# Break Beast Grading Notes

I love the way this app came together -- I know there was some uncertainty at the beginning but I think its really awesome and useful!

-   Tests look great - nice work
-   All the code is really clean and easy to follow
-   The logic in break-tracker is obviously the most complex -- I do wonder if that page could be refactored a little to make it more clean -- are there areas on the timers that could be reused (for example updating the seconds / minutes) -- i know since one of them counts down and another counts up, it might be tricky but perhaps you could isolate that functionality (let me know if you want help thinking about this refactor)
-   Deducted a point because you're technically missing a table with a foreign key other than the user_id (from the requirements)
-   Overall awesome work!
